**Track:** Securities Commission Malaysia  
**Problem Statement:** Enhancing Charity & Donations through Fintech & Technology

## 🧠 Inspiration
While Waqf remains a powerful pillar of Islamic social finance, its potential is often hindered by siloed operations, lack of digital adoption, and transparency issues. We're on a mission to digitize and centralize Waqf donation systems across Malaysia, unifying state Waqf boards under one trusted and Shariah-compliant platform.
